# This is the frontend for the Cramo case at Milj√∏hack 2021
Cramo has established a digital ecosystem to handle the increased need for digitalization of construction sites. Our solution extends this ecosystem by estimating the impact of noise on the local environment.

The solution is built with React with [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling.
The map is made with [react-map-gl](https://github.com/visgl/react-map-gl).

Internationalization is done with [react-i18n](https://react.i18next.com/)
